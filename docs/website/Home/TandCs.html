--- Updated 5 February 2015
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By using Qiqqa, you are agreeing to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.

Qiqqa is Copyright © Quantisle 2010-2015. All rights reserved.

Qiqqa, Qiqqa Premium and the Qiqqa Web Library (from now on “Qiqqa”) are offered as 
Services to you by Quantisle Ltd.

These Terms and Conditions cover the Services currently provided by Qiqqa. However, as we
strive to improve our service to you, new features may be made available to you. In the
event of material change (as determined by Quantisle Ltd.) to our service to you, we will
update these Terms and Conditions and notify you of the changes when you upgrade. We also 
reserve the right to modify or discontinue any of the Services we provide to you. Any 
changes to the Terms and Conditions come into immediate effect as soon as we make them 
publicly available.

Your Content
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You use Qiqqa to manage your research, be it the management of your PDF documents, the 
metadata for those documents (not limited to titles, authors, abstracts and references), 
and any annotations that you may have added to those documents (not limited to ratings 
and keywords) (collectively, “Content”).

By adding Content to Qiqqa and/or syncing your Content with a Web Library, you grant 
Quantisle Ltd. a world-wide license to use this Content for the provision of PERSONALISED 
services to you (not limited to parsing, indexing, transmission and storage) and for the 
provision of ANONYMIZED AGGREGATED services to other users of Qiqqa (not limited to 
aggregated crowd-sourced metadata and group recommendations).  The rights to the 
ownership of the Content remain entirely yours.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Acceptable Content
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following points must be followed in spirit as well as in letter to all forms of your
use of Qiqqa:
•	Quantisle Ltd. is not responsible for the management of any Content provided 
		by you from other parties. If you believe that third-party Content has been, 
		or is being made available to you through Qiqqa in breach of their license or
		rights please let us know immediately via the Qiqqa support website.
•	You will provide only Content, 
		(i) to which you are permitted; 
		(ii) which was produced within, and complies with applicable law in your country 
		and the United Kingdom.
•	You will not provide Content, 
		(i) that encourages illegal activity; 
		(ii) that contains information whose publication (accidental or not) will
		cause financial damages or violate applicable law; 
		(iii) that infringes third-party rights, or that breaches data protection
		or privacy rights; 
		(iv) that will cause detriment to the health of any person.
•	Quantisle Ltd. will not be liable for any losses, damages or claims that arise 
        because of your use of Qiqqa or the provision, storage, loss, transmission, 
        distribution or publication of your Content.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Acceptable use
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will not use Qiqqa,
	(i) to bring Quantisle Ltd. into disrepute;
	(ii) to knowingly reduce our capacity to provide our services,
	(iii) to cause undue cost or damages to Quantisle Ltd.;
	(iv) to reverse engineer our products.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your non-personal information
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Qiqqa continuously collects non-personal information about how you use our services. You
agree that we can use this information to improve our service to you and to others, and
that we may disclose some of this information if required to comply with applicable law.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Services
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Qiqqa provides various for-pay Services (not limited to Unlimited Web Libraries, Qiqqa
Premium and Qiqqa Premium+).

Use of these Services can be purchased, earned (not limited to various promotional 
campaigns and social media incentive programmes) or awarded by an authorised Qiqqa
representative.

Unless otherwise provided by law, all charges resulting from purchases of Services are
earned by Quantisle Ltd. when received and are nonrefundable, and the costs of any 
returns will be at your expense.

Quantisle Ltd. may cancel or suspend your purchased Services at our discretion.  If we 
cancel a Service in its entirety without cause, we'll refund to you on a pro-rata basis 
any payments that you have made based on the portion of the Service that would otherwise 
remain. 

Unless otherwise provided by law, earned and awarded Services have zero monetary value 
whatsoever, are not transferrable, and can be revoked by Quantisle Ltd. at our 
discretion.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Payments to Quantisle Ltd. for the provision of Services
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You must be authorized to use the payment method with which you pay Quantisle Ltd.  You 
authorise us to charge you up-front for the Service at the time of purchase or shortly 
after purchase using your payment method.

When you make a payment to Quantisle Ltd. for a Service, you understand that Qiqqa 
endeavours to provide the Service immediately.  To this effect you will not be entitled 
to a cancellation or "cooling off" period, except if the law requires a cooling off 
period despite your waiver and even when a Service starts right away.

Services are provided on an account top-up basis by your instruction, and therefore 
there is no basis nor need for you to cancel a Service.

The price stated for the Service includes all taxes and PayPal fees. You're responsible 
for all other charges accrued to your payment method.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Termination
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quantisle Ltd. reserves the right to terminate at our discretion your use of Qiqqa and 
delete from Qiqqa any Content you have stored with Qiqqa. At our discretion we will 
endeavour to give you reasonable notice in this eventuality unless you are materially 
in breach of these Terms and Conditions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Quantisle Ltd. provides Qiqqa 
on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or 
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,

responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing Qiqqa and 
assume any risks associated with your exercise of permissions under these Terms and 
Conditions.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Limitation of Liability

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, 
or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent 
acts) or agreed to in writing, shall Quantisle Ltd. be liable to you for damages, 
including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any 
character arising as a result of these Terms and Conditions or out of the use or 
inability to use Qiqqa (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work 
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or 
losses), even if you had been advised of the possibility of such damages.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Trademarks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These Terms and Conditions do not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, 
service marks or product names of Quantisle Ltd, including the product name Qiqqa, except

By submitting your application for being an affiliate of the Site, you agree to be
bound by the Terms as stated herein without modification.

arrangement with you.

4. Ownership and use of Qiqqa Materials
"Qiqqa Materials" include any legal materials, documents, contracts, software, 
products, web links, promotional material, email, information, partial Qiqqa

Code purchases a Qiqqa Premium or Premium+ subscription.  In lieu of a commission 
(or in lieu of part of it), you can elect to purchase Qiqqa services of equivalent 
value (but not applicable to fees paid to external service providers or fees paid 
to external suppliers).  Payments are calculated on a monthly basis and payment will 
be sent within five business days when commissions payable total $50 or more.

After 10 years of your support we have decided to make Qiqqa open source so that it can be grown and extended by its community of thousands of active users.

<br />

<br />

NB: We will be discontinuing Web Library support for Qiqqa at the end of 2020.  So you’ll have one year within which to install the latest version of Open Source Qiqqa (which is improving daily), <b>migrate your Web Libraries into Intranet Libraries</b>, and enjoy all the Premium and Premium+ features of Qiqqa for free (except Web Libraries)!

<br />


Go to the <a href="https://github.com/jimmejardine/qiqqa-open-source">Qiqqa Open Source GitHub website</a>.

<br />

<a href="TandCs.html#" onclick="jQuery('#closing-down').remove()">Close</a>
