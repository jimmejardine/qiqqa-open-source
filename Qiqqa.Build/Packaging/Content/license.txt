Services
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Qiqqa provides various for-pay Services (not limited to Unlimited Web Libraries, Qiqqa
Premium and Qiqqa Premium+).

Use of these Services can be purchased, earned (not limited to various promotional 
campaigns and social media incentive programmes) or awarded by an authorised Qiqqa
representative.

Unless otherwise provided by law, all charges resulting from purchases of Services are
earned by Quantisle Ltd. when received and are nonrefundable, and the costs of any 
returns will be at your expense.

Quantisle Ltd. may cancel or suspend your purchased Services at our discretion.  If we 
cancel a Service in its entirety without cause, we'll refund to you on a pro-rata basis 
any payments that you have made based on the portion of the Service that would otherwise 
remain. 

Unless otherwise provided by law, earned and awarded Services have zero monetary value 
whatsoever, are not transferrable, and can be revoked by Quantisle Ltd. at our 
discretion.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Payments to Quantisle Ltd. for the provision of Services
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You must be authorized to use the payment method with which you pay Quantisle Ltd.  You 
authorise us to charge you up-front for the Service at the time of purchase or shortly 
after purchase using your payment method.

When you make a payment to Quantisle Ltd. for a Service, you understand that Qiqqa 
endeavours to provide the Service immediately.  To this effect you will not be entitled 
to a cancellation or "cooling off" period, except if the law requires a cooling off 
period despite your waiver and even when a Service starts right away.

Services are provided on an account top-up basis by your instruction, and therefore 
there is no basis nor need for you to cancel a Service.

The price stated for the Service includes all taxes and PayPal fees. You're responsible 
for all other charges accrued to your payment method.
